# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We don't do releases of the CryptPad Documentation, deployments are directly handled on our servers.

In case of issue we'd likely communicate about it on:
- [Our blog](https://blog.cryptpad.org)
- [Our Matrix public space](https://matrix.to/#/#cryptpad:matrix.xwiki.com)
- [Our Mastodon account](https://social.xwiki.com/@CryptPad)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported using the GitHub Security interface. You can also send us an email at security@cryptpad.org
