"The very function of most CryptPad applications is based on collaboration"
" between different users. These applications allow a user to write "
"content that will be displayed in another user's browser. A major "
"concern, then, is to **prevent malicious actors from sending code that "
"will be executed by another user's browser** (XSS vulnerability). To "
"prevent this possibility, CryptPad uses 3 main mechanisms to guarantee "
"data security."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:25
msgid ""
"The first element to respect when writing code for CryptPad is to use "
"\"sanitizers\", i.e. tools that clean up user content displayed to "
"others. These sanitizers must remove anything that can be used to execute"
" JavaScript, such as ``onclick=\"...\"`` HTML attributes or ``<script>`` "
"tags."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:27
msgid ""
"The second element is managed by the server and adds additional "
"protection. The server sends **Content-Security-Policy** rules to users. "
"These rules allow the browser to know what it can safely do and what is "
"potentially dangerous and must be blocked. These are numerous but mainly "
"concern JavaScript:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:29
msgid ""
"We cannot load JavaScript code from an external site (CDN). All "
"JavaScript files loaded by CryptPad must be hosted on the domain "
"represented by the ``httpUnsafeOrigin`` field in the configuration file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:30
msgid ""
"We can't execute \"inline\" JavaScript, i.e. using HTML attributes such "
"as ``<span onclick=\"alert('test');\">Click</span>``. The event handlers "
"must be added from the JavaScript code directly: "
"``span.addEventListener('click', onClick);``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:31
msgid "We cannot evaluate a string as code with the ``eval()`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:33
msgid ""
"Finally, at the third level, if an \"XSS\" vulnerability exists and CSP "
"rules can be bypassed, a last mechanism can be used to protect a CryptPad"
" account from malicious users. CryptPad works with a \"sandbox\" system: "
"the whole interface is created inside an iframe open on a different HTTP "
"origin than the one of the browser tab (which contains the user account "
"data). In a development instance, this separation is done using 2 "
"different ports: ``http://localhost:3000`` for the main tab and "
"``http://localhost:3001`` for the sandbox iframe. The entire "
"collaborative interface being rendered in this iframe, if code was "
"injected by another user, it could only be executed at this level. The "
"\"origin\" difference between the sandbox and the tab itself would "
"protect the rest of your account: **the malicious user would only be able"
" to recover the data from the document they already have access to**."

"When writing code for CryptPad, it is important to remember that there "
"are many CryptPad instances and that their administrators sometimes want "
"to customize UI elements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:40
msgid ""
"In order to make the upgrade process easier when such modifications are "
"present, the elements that the development team believes can be "
"customized without risk are stored in the ``customize.dist`` folder. Each"
" file stored in this directory can be modified by creating a "
"``customize`` folder containing a copy of the original file. If a file "
"exists in ``customize``, it will be served to users instead of its "
"namesake in ``customize.dist``. Note that :ref:`dev_translations` can "
"also be customized. For more information please see "
":ref:`admin_customization` in the administrator guide."

"Most images, logos and LESS style files are therefore placed in "

"CryptPad uses a sandbox system containing the entire UI of the "
"collaborative tools. When a script needs to update the content of the "
"drive, teams, contacts or any other element that should not be accessible"
" to other users, this code must be outside of the sandbox."

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:52
msgid ""
"CryptPad uses SharedWorker technology (when the browser supports it) to "
"share a \"thread\" between all the browser tabs open on the same CryptPad"
" instance. Code that concerns all CryptPad applications can be placed at "
"this level to avoid running it once in each tab."

"CryptPad is officially translated (by the development team) into English "
"(default language) and French. Many other languages are available, but "
"translations are made by the community via our `Weblate platform "

msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/basics.rst:59
msgid ""
":ref:`dev_translations` must be added manually by the development team to"
" Weblate. To make it easier to merge contributions into the main branch, "
"we ask contributor **not to add their new translation keys directly into "
"the translation files**. The requested translation keys can be listed "
"either in the \"pull request\" message or as a comment in the code "
"directly. It's also preferable to add at least either an English or a "
"French version of the text."
