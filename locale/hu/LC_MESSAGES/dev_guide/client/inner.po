"The inner level corresponds to the entire visible interface of CryptPad. "
"It represents an iframe that is completely isolated from the content of "
"the user's account. Each CryptPad application has its own interface, but "
"many elements are common to all applications, with functionality "
"remaining the same in the majority of cases. Only the way the data is "
"displayed changes completely."

"The JavaScript starting point of the \"inner\" level corresponds to the "

"elements for the iframe to work and manages the data representation in "
"the selected application. Whether the application uses the \"framework\" "
"system or not, the overall operation remains the same: the sframe-common "
"module loads the communication system with \"outer\" and initializes "
"different elements."
