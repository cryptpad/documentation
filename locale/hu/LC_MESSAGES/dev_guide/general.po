"CryptPad uses a sandboxing system that isolates the user interface from "
"the in-memory content. For user experience reasons, it is necessary to "
"keep in memory all the information of the current user account (drive "
"content, contact list, teams, etc.). The interface, which is the exposed "
"part of the structure, could contain vulnerabilities and is therefore not"
" \"shown\" any user information. It receives only data relevant for the "
"current document. This isolation system has been implemented by putting "
"the entire user interface in an iframe that takes up the whole window and"
" that shows the **safe** URL. The base level (parent of the iframe) "
"contains the sensitive data and is opened on the **unsafe** URL."

"Contrary to classical systems where the username and the password hash "

"function must be as fast as possible. Since it is used to manage the "

"In summary, when you **register** on CryptPad, your credentials are used "

"When a user wants to **change their password**, there is therefore no "
