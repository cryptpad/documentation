" whether or not the latest updates were applied by the administrators."

#: ../../FAQ.rst:130
msgid ""
"To address these problems, the development team is working on making "
"CryptPad a \"Progressive Web App\". This means that it can be used on "
"mobile through the web browser, behaving like an application while being "
"the same software that runs on desktop browsers. This has the benefit of "

"The CryptPad :ref:`app_sheets` application is an integration of "
"`OnlyOffice Spreadsheets <https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/spreadsheet-"
"editor.aspx>`_. However, this only concerns the client-side code, "
"CryptPad does not make use of the OnlyOffice Document Server. CryptPad's "
"encrypted collaboration, used for spreadsheets and other applications, is"
" completely different from the encryption system used in parts of "
"upstream OnlyOffice. Some of CryptPad's file format conversion tools are "
"based on OnlyOffice code, but substantial work has been done to make it "
"run in the browser rather than on the server, therefore avoiding the need"
" to reveal the contents of users' documents when converting."

#: ../../FAQ.rst:152
msgid ""
"CryptPad aims at protecting the identity of its users and their content "

"The instance administrators are assumed to be *honest-but-curious*, "

"information as they can from what they can perceive. We maintain a list "
"of `CryptPad public instances <https://cryptpad.org/instances>`_ for "
"which we verified that they are up-to-date and well configured;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ.rst:157
msgid ""
"The communication channels cannot be trusted and can be *actively "
"malicious*: external threat are able to tamper, replay or drop messages. "
"This should not alter the security of CryptPad;"

#: ../../FAQ.rst:158
msgid ""
"The users you share your document are *honest* as once you send your "
"content, they are trusted not to leak it. However, your *identity* "
"remains oblivious to them in a weak form of anonymity: they have access "
"to your public key and your display name;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ.rst:160
msgid ""
"Therefore, the *share link* should be considered *as sensitive as a "
"passphrase*. To add another layer of security, we recommend adding a "
"password to your files. If you have an account, it is stored in your "
"CryptDrive (which is considered secure) and the access remains seamless. "
