"The \"outer\" level represents the starting point of the CryptPad code. "
"Except for the initial HTML file loaded by the browser, this level is "
"entirely made of JavaScript code. It is split into two main files, which "
"are connected to the iframe inner for one and to the worker for the "
"other. The APIs used to communicate are the same in both cases."

"The communication is done using ``www/common/outer/worker-channel.js``, a"
" mini-library developed in CryptPad. This library allows two systems to "
"send \"query\" and \"event\" messages to each other. A \"query\" consists"
" of sending data and waiting for a response, while an \"event\" is just "
"sending data."

"This library automatically manages callbacks for received answers and "
"allows each party to indicate when it is ready to communicate. The way "
"messages are sent is managed outside the library thanks to a "
"``sendMessage`` function that is provided as an argument. If it is a "
"query, a callback is included with the data."
