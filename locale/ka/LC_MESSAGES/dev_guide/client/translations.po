"The CryptPad interface is officially available in English and French. It "
"is also translated (fully or partially) by the community into many other "
"languages, German being the most actively maintained. This localization "
"system works with a set of translation keys used in the code. Almost all "
"the text displayed on the screen comes from such keys. The text "
"associated to each key is stored in a single separate file. Although it "
"is easy to use, this system has a complex structure."

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/translations.rst:11
msgid ""
"In order to use the translation keys in the code, just load the "
"\"Messages\" module with RequireJS. This module is available at "
"``/customize/messages.js`` and automatically uses the language chosen by "
"the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/translations.rst:13
msgid ""
"Once the module is loaded, ``Messages`` represents an object containing "
"all the translation keys and can therefore be used in the code with "
"``Messages.translationKey`` which will refer to the text of the "
"\"translationKey\" in the user's language."

msgid "Structure"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/translations.rst:18
msgid ""
"As detailed at the start of this guide, each instance of CryptPad can be "
"customized, for example using bespoke images, logos, styles and static "
"pages. Translation keys are also customizable elements, which makes the "
"structure of the system more complex."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/translations.rst:20
msgid ""
"The keys are first created and translated in JSON files obtained from "
"`Weblate <https://weblate.cryptpad.org>`__. These files are available in "
"the ``www/common/translations/`` directory. There you can find for "
"example ``www/common/translations/messages.json`` (default English "
"version) or ``www/common/translations/messages.fr.json`` (French "
"version). These files cannot be customized directly because it would "
"create merge conflicts for the instance administrators when upgrading "
"CryptPad to a newer version (one key missing in the default translation "
"file may in some cases make some features unusable)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/translations.rst:22
msgid ""
"In order to allow this customization step, the translation files are "
"loaded in **language modules** present in the "
"``customize.dist/translations/`` directory. The English and French "
"versions exist there as ``customize.dist/translations/messages.js`` and "
"``customize.dist/translations/messages.fr.js``. These language modules "
"load their corresponding JSON file and allow administrators to extend or "
"modify them. For more information on how to customize translation keys "
"please see :ref:`admin_customization` in the administrator guide."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/translations.rst:24
msgid ""
"Finally, the file ``customize.dist/messages.js`` will retrieve the "
"**language module** corresponding to the user's language (English by "
"default). If a string is not translated into the chosen language, the "
"English version will be used instead for this string."
