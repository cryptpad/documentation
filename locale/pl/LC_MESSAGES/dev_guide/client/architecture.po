"separate thread for heavier calculations, but it strongly slows down the "
"loading of tabs when the user account contains a lot of data. Finally, if"
" the WebWorkers have been disabled in the browser, a last-resort system "
"is in place to perform the work of the worker in the main tab at the "

"thread must not be overloaded at the risk of slowing down all the tabs. "

"The important elements loaded by \"inner.js\" are about the communication"
" with **outer**, the common interface elements (toolbar, reusable menus, "
"etc.) but also the whole style of the application. The style is loaded by"

"The purpose of the main **inner** iframe is to work with a different "
"domain (or HTTP origin), which benefits from additional \"cross-domain\" "
"protections. This iframe is the only part of the system that displays an "
"interface where users interact with each other, which makes it "
"particularly vulnerable in case of a code flaw. Isolating it, on the one "
"hand within an iframe, and on the other hand with a different domain, "
"makes it possible to protect all data that is not directly displayed in "
"the document. It is in fact **impossible to recover the keys of the "
"current document** from the **inner** iframe. Only the decrypted content "
"is accessible, as well as the public data of the user and the current "
"users of the pad."

"application (content rendering). The \"share\", \"access\", "
