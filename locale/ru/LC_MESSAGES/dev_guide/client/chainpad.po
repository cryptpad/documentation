"In the database, collaborative documents (i.e. documents that are not "

"ChainPad is the basis of CryptPad's \"real-time engine\". Starting from "
"the same fixed starting point (which can be empty), several users can "
"open the same document. ChainPad works exclusively with documents in "
"\"text\" format in theory, but solutions exist in practice for other "
"JavaScript data formats."

"Each user initializes a local ChainPad \"object\" and fills it with the "
"patch history of the database from a given starting point. The patches "
"contain a set of simple operations to perform on the document (e.g. "
"\"remove X characters and add 'abc' at the Y position\") as well as a "
"\"parent\". Storing a parent identifier in the patch allows for the "
"document to be re-built with the patches in the correct order. Applying "
"the full set of patches from a starting point (usually an empty string) "
"produces the latest version of the document."

#: ../../dev_guide/client/chainpad.rst:13
msgid ""
"Once the document is restored, CryptPad detects each change made in the "
"application in order to generate a new \"local\" version of the document "
"and provides this version to ChainPad. ChainPad then analyzes it, finding"
" all the differences between the new version and the previous version. "
"These differences are used to **create a new \"patch\"** that is "
"encrypted by CryptPad, sent to other users, and stored in the database."

"When **receiving a patch** in real time from another user, ChainPad tries"
" to integrate it into the current document. If unsaved changes (patch not"
" yet created) are in progress by the current user, ChainPad first merges "
"the local changes with the remote patch before inserting the updated "
"content into the interface. This merge allows users to make many changes "
"simultaneously without losing characters in the content."

"ChainPad also includes tools to **manage conflicts**. While the order of "
"the patches is known, thanks to the parent identifier, the delay for all "
"users to receive patches can result in two users sending patches with the"
" same parent at the same time. This creates a \"fork\" in the patch tree."
" As the patches are encrypted, the server cannot determine how to resolve"
" these conflicts. ChainPad has to handle them in each user's browser. To "
"ensure that the result of \"merging\" the branching patches is identical "
"for all users, ChainPad checks the order of the messages received by the "
"server. Two patches can have the same parent, but one of these patches "
"still reaches the server before the other. WebSocket technology "
"guarantees that messages sent by the server to the various clients arrive"
" in the order in which the server sent them. The ChainPads of all users "
"therefore know which patches have the same parent and the order in which "
"to process them, which is enough to achieve the same result everywhere."

"In order to avoid having to synchronize the complete history of the "
"document since its creation each time a collaborative document is loaded,"
" ChainPad uses a system of **checkpoints**. Every 50 patches stored in "
"the database, the user creating the patch will in fact create a special "
"patch called a checkpoint. Such a patch consists in a single operation "
"that deletes the entire document and re-inserts it at the same time. "
"Checkpoints have the particularity that they can be used as starting "
"points for the system. Checkpoints also have a special marking added "
"after encryption that allows the server to identify them as such."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a user loads an existing document and asks for its history, the "
"server will only send all patches starting from the penultimate "
"checkpoint (in theory the last checkpoint is sufficient, but the "
"penultimate one makes it easier to solve some problems). This system "
"saves considerable loading time for documents that are heavily used over "
"long periods of time. It also allows document owners to delete the old "
"history, only keeping the messages from the last two checkpoints in the "
"database."

"As mentioned above, ChainPad only works with text documents. This means "
"that the only operations it can perform are to add or remove characters "
"at a given position relative to the beginning of the document. Therefore,"
" ChainPad cannot work with objects or arrays directly, for example using "
"an operation that requires the 3rd element of an array to be changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/chainpad.rst:41
msgid ""
"However, many CryptPad applications require to work with objects or "
"arrays. In the Code/Markdown application for example, objects are used to"
" store the title of the document and its content at the same time. In the"
" drive, this is more obvious because the structure of the drive itself "
"with its organization in folders can be easily represented as a tree in a"
" JavaScript object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/chainpad.rst:43
msgid ""
"A **basic solution** would be for ChainPad to work with the string "
"representation of the object (with ``JSON.stringify``) and to transform "
"it back into an object once the work of ChainPad has been done (with "
"``JSON.parse``). The problem with this kind of solution is that conflict "
"management may destroy the document!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev_guide/client/chainpad.rst:45

"To solve this problem, it is possible to initialize an instance of "
"ChainPad with a **specific algorithm to handle conflicts**, as well as an"
" **algorithm to validate a patch**. When you want to work with an object,"
" for a patch to be valid, ``JSON.parse()`` must not generate an error. If"
" an error occurs, the patch is simply ignored."

"JavaScript \"Proxies\" are an extension of classical JavaScript objects "

"This library integrates Chainpad-netflux, detailed above, which provides "

"connection address to the server. Chainpad-listmap directly returns a "
"Proxy. The Proxy can be used as any JavaScript object and changing its "
"content in any way will automatically propagate these changes to other "
"users. Events are triggered on this object in several cases: \"ready\" "
"when the history is synchronized, \"change\" when an element is added or "
