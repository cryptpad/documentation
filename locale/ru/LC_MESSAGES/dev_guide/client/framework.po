"Most of CryptPad's collaborative applications work in a similar way, only"
" differing in the ways that data is displayed. Therefore, a large part of"
" their code can be shared. There is already a lot of code common to "
"several parts of CryptPad, but in the case of collaborative applications,"
" this goes even further."

"The ``main.js`` file is the only JavaScript file of \"outer\" that is "

"special commands for the database. For example, in the Drive application "
"it is necessary to have access to the complete contents of the drive in "
"the \"inner\" iframe. So this application is the only one that has full "
"access to the user account, and this access is provided by the "
"``main.js`` file."
