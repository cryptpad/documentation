"**Async-store** contains all the functions representing the commands sent"
" by **outer**. Its role is to manage the connection to the user account, "
"load the sub-structures linked to this account (shared folders, profile, "
"teams) and load all the modules that extend its use. It creates two main "
"objects, named ``store`` and ``Store``. The first one represents the "
"memory of the worker and stores everything that has been loaded, the "
"second one represents its \"muscles\" and contains all the functions that"
" can be executed by the commands of **outer**. Many modules are loaded to"
" perform specific tasks and are accessible via ``store``."
