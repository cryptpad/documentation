CryptPad calendars work in the same way as any other documents for the purposes of :ref:`sharing <share>` and :ref:`regulating access <access>`.

The |ellipsis-h| menu for each calendar in the sidebar contains the following options:

- |pencil| **Edit** to change the calendar name and color
- |share-alt| **Share** and |unlock-alt| **Access** function the same way as any other CryptPad document. see :ref:`share_and_access`.

.. note::
   When exporting a calendar, the descriptions of events are exported in Markdown.

:ref:`teams` can also have calendars available to all members. Simply share a calendar with a team to add it:

|share-alt| **Share** > |address-book| **Contacts** > Select the team

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

When viewing a calendar shared via link, add it to your calendars with: |calendar-plus-o| **Import this calendar**

.. _contacts:

Contacts
--------

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

On CryptPad, using contacts makes collaboration more secure and simple.

Add a contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By sharing your profile:

1. Copy the link: User menu (avatar at the top-right) > |user-circle| **Profile** > |share-alt| **Share**.
2. Paste and send through the means of your choice (preferably a secure mode of cummunication).
3. Your contact must then click **Send a contact request**.
4. You get a notification with the request, ``Click`` **Accept**.

On the profile page of another CryptPad user:

1. ``Click`` **Send a contact request**.

Manage contacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access the Contacts page:

-  User menu (avatar at the top-right) > |address-book| **Contacts**.

All contacts are listed at the left of the window. For each contact:

* |bell-slash|: Mute messages and notifications.
* |user-times|: Remove.
* |circle|: Indicates that this contact is online.

.. _chat_contacts:

Chat with contacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the Contacts page, click on a contact in the list to open the chat with them in the main window.

Write messages in the field at the bottom and send them with |paper-plane| or :kbd:`Enter`.

Load more chat history with |history| or delete the history with |eraser|.

.. note::

   Currently, the only way to get a notification when receiving a new message, is having the Contacts application open and web browser notifications enabled. We are working on the possibility to receive a CryptPad notification in case of a new message.

.. _teams:

Teams
-----

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

CryptPad teams are shared spaces between a group of users. A team has its own CryptDrive, chat, and a list of members with roles and permissions.

.. note::

   The number of teams a CryptPad user can join used to be limited to 3 for performance reasons. This has now been increased to 5 as we have added details to the loading screen that show how long teams take to load. This allows users to negotiate the tradeoff between number of teams and increased loading time.


To create a team:

#. User menu (avatar at the top-right) > |users| **Teams**.
#. |plus-circle| **New**.

To open an existing team:

#. User menu (avatar at the top-right) > |users| **Teams**.
#. |list| **Teams** > **Open** button on the desired team.

Team Drive
~~~~~~~~~~

The team storage space is similar to the :ref:`CryptDrive <drive>` but shared between members of the team.

Team members
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manage the members of a team, go to the |users| **Members** tab.

Invite members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To invite members to a team:

-  |users| **Members** tab > **Invite members**.

|address-book| **Contacts** tab: Select CryptPad contacts to invite them to the team. Invitees receive an invite notification and can confirm they want to join the team.

|link| **Link** tab: Copy a link to send through the means of your choice (preferably a secure mode of cummunication). This link is single-use only. It becomes invalid after someone first uses it to join the team.

-  **Temporary name**: Used to identify the invite link in the list of pending invitations.

-  **Password**: Protect the link against potiential interception. (optional)

-  **Personal message**: Message that the recipient will see before they decide to accept the invitation to join the team.
