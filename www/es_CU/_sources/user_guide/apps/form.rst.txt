Roles
-----

Forms benefit from the same collaboration and privacy features as the other CryptPad applications. They also have slightly different requirements when it comes to usage, for example someone responding to a form should be able to edit their own answers but not other users' answers or the form itself. For this reason the :ref:`share_access_rights` when sharing a form are different from the other applications. Forms have 3 different roles:

- **Author**: can edit questions and :ref:`form settings <form_settings>`.
- **Auditor**: can view responses to the form whether or not they are public.
- **Participant**: can answer the form and only view responses once they are made public by an author.

To share a form with a specific role, for example to send it to participants, select the role in the |share-alt| **Share** menu before selecting contacts or copying the link.

.. note::

   The user list, chat, and alerts about users joining the collaborative session are all disabled when a participant is responding to a form. This is to avoid giving the impression that someone is watching while they answer.

Editing a form
---------------

To add a question, use the |plus| **Add** menu after the last question, or the |plus| between each question.

To delete a question use the |trash-o| **Delete** button on the question to remove.

Advanced use-cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anonymous responses with access list
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To conduct an anonymous survey with a known group of users, the anonymous answers feature can be combined with an :ref:`access_list`.

To access the form, participants need to be logged in to an account that is on the access list (either directly or through a :ref:`team <teams>` they are part of).

If anonymous answers are allowed on the form, participants are able to answer anonymously while the access list ensures they are coming from a specific group of users.

Import/Export
-------------

Form documents themselves can be exported and imported in ``JSON`` format.

To export responses, from the |bar-chart| **Responses** page, you have two possibilities:

#. as a CSV or JSON file use the |download| **EXPORT** button

#. as a Spreadsheet that can be added to your drive with the **EXPORT TO SHEET** button

.. note::
   
   The Spreadsheet document will automatically be populated with the data from your form at the time you create it. However, due to how end-to-end encryption works, the spreadsheet content won't be automatically updated with new responses as they arrive.
