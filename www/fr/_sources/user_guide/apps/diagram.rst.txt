Documentation
-------------

Please refer to the `Draw.io documentation <https://www.drawio.com/doc/>`__ for a diagram user-guide.

Toolbars
--------

CryptPad integrates Draw.io diagrams into the same encrypted collaboration system as the other applications. Additionally Draw.io provides a wide range of functions in a tabbed toolbar. This results in a double toolbar that can cause confusion:

- The topmost **CryptPad toolbar** is used for |file-o| **File** operations (including import/export, history, properties, etc) as well as |share-alt| **Share** and |unlock-alt| **Access**.
- The **Draw.io toolbar** is used for all functionality within the diagram document itself.

Import/Export
-------------

| |file-o| **File** > |upload| **Import**.
| Supported formats: ``.drawio``

| |file-o| **File** > |download| **Export**.
| Supported formats: ``.png``, ``.jpg``, ``.svg``, ``.pdf``
