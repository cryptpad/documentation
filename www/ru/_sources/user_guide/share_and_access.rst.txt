.. _share_and_access:

Share / Access
==============

|share-alt| **Share** and |unlock-alt| **Access** are the two menus to manage how other users can interact with your documents on CryptPad.

-  From the document toolbar: |share-alt| **Share** and |unlock-alt| **Access** at the center.
-  From the CryptDrive: ``Right click`` on a document > |share-alt| **Share** or |unlock-alt| **Access**.

.. _share:

Share
-----

There are three ways to share a document: :ref:`share_contacts`, :ref:`share_link`, and :ref:`share_embed`. In each case, access rights can be set to authorise the recipient to edit the document, or to only view it.

.. _share_access_rights:

Access rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 4 levels of permissions:

-  **View**: Read-only without editing the document.
-  **Present**: Read-only the rendered output of the document, available in the :ref:`app_code` and :ref:`app_slides` applications.
-  **Edit**: View and make changes to the document.
-  **View once and self-destruct**: Read-only **one time**. Once the link is opened by a recipient, the document is deleted permanently. :badge_user:`Logged in users`

.. note::

   If a document is already stored in the CryptDrive of a user with edit rights, the “edit link” is shown in the document’s properties even if the user is in View mode.

.. _share_contacts:

Sharing with contacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

This is the recommended method for sharing documents securely on CryptPad. When sharing directly with :ref:`contacts <contacts>`, document links never leave the encrypted platform of CryptPad. This prevents data from being leaked to third parties.

   :class: screenshot


To share with one or more contacts:

-  |share-alt| **Share** in the document toolbar > |address-book| **Contacts**.
-  ``Right click`` on the document in the CryptDrive > |share-alt| **Share** > |address-book| **Contacts**.

Then:

#. Choose the :ref:`access rights <share_access_rights>`.
#. Select the contacts or teams to share with.
#. **Share** button.

.. note::

   When sharing with contacts, they receive a notification.
   When sharing with a team, the document is added directly to the team’s CryptDrive.

.. _share_link:

Sharing a link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Link** tab provides links that can be shared through the medium of your choice. Depending on how you send the link, this method can present security risks. To add a level of security, it is recommended to add a :ref:`password <access_tab>` to your document before sharing the link.

.. image:: /images/modal-share-link.png
   :class: screenshot

To copy the link to a document:

-  From the document: |share-alt| **Share** in the toolbar > |link| **Link**.
-  From the CryptDrive : ``Right click`` on the document > |share-alt| **Share** > |link| **Link**.

Then:

#. Choose the :ref:`access rights <share_access_rights>` and additional options:

   * **Embed mode** hides the toolbar and user list.
   * **Preview** allows to check what the link will look like before sending it.

#. **Copy** the link.
#. Send the link.

.. _share_embed:

Embedding
~~~~~~~~~

Embedding allows for a CryptPad document to be displayed on a web page.

.. image:: /images/modal-share-embed.png
   :class: screenshot

To embed a document:

-  From the document : |share-alt| **Share** in the toolbar > |code| **Embed**.
-  From the CryptDrive : ``Right click`` on the document > |share-alt| **Share** > |code| **Embed**.

then

1. Choose the :ref:`access rights <share_access_rights>`.
2. **Copy** the embed code.
3. Paste the code on a web page.

.. _shared_folders:

Shared folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

Shared folders are made for sharing a set of documents at once.

To create a shared folder in the CryptDrive:

-  ``+ New`` > |cptools shared-folder| **Shared folder**.
-  :kbd:`Ctrl + e` > |cptools shared-folder| **Shared folder**.
-  ``Right click`` > |cptools shared-folder| **New shared folder**.

2. Choose the conversion options.
   Password.
   :ref:`Owned <owners>` folder.
3. ``OK`` or press the :kbd:`Enter` key.

Folders are shared in a similar way to documents. To share a folder from the CryptDrive:

1. ``Right click`` on the folder > |share-alt| **Share**.
2. Choose the `access rights <#access-rights>`__.
   **View**: Read-only without editing the contents of the folder.
   **Edit**: View and make changes to the folder.
3. Three tabs are available:
   |address-book| **Contacts**: Recommended method to share securely
   with contacts and teams on CryptPad.
   |link| **Link**: Copy a link to send through the medium of your
   choice.
   |code| **Embed**: Copy code to include the folder on a web page.

.. note::

   Shared folders have their own history, separate from the :ref:`drive_history`. Restoring the history of the drive does not affect shared folders, conversely the history of a shared folder can be restored without affecting the rest of the drive.

   Please note that, once shared, they cannot be reverted to normal folders.

.. _access:

------

:badge_user:`Logged in users`

.. _access_list:

Access List
~~~~~~~~~~~

:badge_owner:`Document owners`


.. image:: /images/modal-access-list.png
   :class: screenshot

The access list restricts access to a document. Once active, users who are not on the list are not able to access the document, even if they have it stored in their CryptDrive.

To enable the access list, tick **Enable access list**. The `owners <#owners>`__ of the document are on the list by default and cannot be removed from it.

To add contacts or teams to the list:

1. Select them in the list of contacts on the right.
2. Add them to the list with the |arrow-left| button.

To remove a user or team from the list use the |times| button next to their name.

.. _owners:

Owners
~~~~~~

.. image:: /images/modal-access-owners.png
   :class: screenshot

-  Enable an :ref:`access list <access_list>`.
-  Enable a password.
-  Add or remove other owners.
-  Destroy the document.

The ownership of a document is set when :ref:`creating it<new_document>`.

.. note::

   If a document is created without owners, no one has permissions to manage its ownership. It cannot be permanently destroyed by anyone, but can be removed from the CryptDrive and will be destroyed automatically after 90 days of inactivity.

:badge_owner:`Document owners`

To add users or teams as owners:

1. Select them in the list of contacts on the right.
